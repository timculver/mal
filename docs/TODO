All:
    - Finish guide.md

    - test that *ARGV* gets set properly
    - test to make sure slurp captures final newline
    - Give runtest knowledge of optional tests and report as non-fatal
    - regular expression matching in runtest
    - add re (use in rep) everywhere and use that (to avoid printing)
    - per impl tests for step5_tco, or at least a better way of
      enabling/disabling/tweaking per implementation
    - fix stepA failures: lua matlab miniMAL perl racket

Other ideas for All:
    - propagate/print errors when self-hosted
    - redefine (defmacro!) as (def! (macro*))
    - Fix/implement interop in more implementations

    - metadata on symbols (as per Clojure)
    - metadata as a map only. ^ merges metadata in the reader itself.
      Line numbers in metadata from reader.
    - protocols!
        - https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie

    - namespaces
        - environments first class: *ENV*, *outer* defined by env-new
        - namespaces is *namespaces* map in environment which maps namespace
          names to other environments.
        - def! become an alias for (env-set! *ENV* 'sym value)
        - Namespace lookup: go up the environment hierarchy until
          a *namespaces* map is found with the namespace name being
          looked up. Then the symbol would be looked up starting in
          the namespace environment. Need protocols first probably.
    - Fix quasiquoting of vectors

    - multi-line REPL read
    - loop/recur ?
    - gensym reader inside quasiquote

Clojure:
    - make indent consistent across steps (e.g. step5, step8)
    - fix mal/clojurewest2014.mal

CoffeeScript:
    - make target to compile to JS
    - fix "user> " prompt with mal/clojurewest2014.mal

Go:
    - consider variable arguments in places where it makes sense
        https://gobyexample.com/variadic-functions

Haskell:
    - TCO using seq/bang patterns:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9149183/tail-optimization-guarantee-loop-encoding-in-haskell
    - immediately exits mal/clojurewest2014.mal

Java:
    - Use gradle instead of mvn
        http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2014/05/01/modern-java/
    - MAL formatting is a bit off with mal/clojurewest2014.mal

Javascript:
    - interop: adopt techniques from miniMAL
    - fix "user> " prompt with mal/clojurewest2014.mal

Lua:
    - time-ms should get actual milliseconds

Make:
    - allow '_' in make variable names
    - hash-map with space in key string
    - Fix: make -f stepA_mal.mk ../mal/step6_file.mal
        (slurp "../tests/incA.mal")
        (read-string "(+ 2 3)")
    - errors should propagate up from within load-file
